  Output: 'If at any time you need help with R, you can type help.start() at the prompt which will open an index of R materials. Many R resources are also available on the web and are easily found through a web search.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We will put double quotes around the names of R objects. However, in actual R code, there are only a few cases where you will need to put them in quotation marks.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Let''s start by practicing arithmetic operations by using R as a basic calculator.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Next, we will practice creating objects and giving them names.'

# Question 4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Try assigning 8 - 2 the name "result".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'result <- 8 - 2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='result <- 8 - 2')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Type the name of the object we created above.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'result'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='result')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

- Class: text
  Output: 'We can also give a name to a string of characters'

# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Give the phrase ''social science'' the name "course".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'course <- "social science"'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='course <- "social science"')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Notice that spaces are allowed in character strings.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'We can also change what a name refers to by assigning a new object to it.'

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now make "course" refer to ''learning R''.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'course <- "learning R"'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='course <- "learning R"')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'When we assign an existing object to a new name we always make a copy of it.'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Assign the value of "result" to "result2"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'result2 <- result'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='result2 <- result')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.'

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now make "result" name the value of 10 minus 2'
  CorrectAnswer: 'result <- 10 - 2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='result <- 10 - 2')
  Hint: See 'Objects'.'

# Question 10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What do you think R will return when we type "c(result, result2)"?'
  AnswerChoices: 'a six and a six; an eight and a six; a six and an eight; an eight and an eight'
  CorrectAnswer: an eight and a six
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'an eight and a six')

- Class: text
  Output: 'Next, we are going to start working with real data: estimates of world population (in thousands). A vector of data called "world.pop" has been loaded with this lesson. The first element is for the year 1950 up to the last element for 2010.'

# Question 11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Check what "world.pop" refers to.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'world.pop'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('world.pop', 'print(world.pop)')
  Hint: See 'Vectors'.

# Question 12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use indexing to look at the 4th element of the "world.pop" vector.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'world.pop[4]'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='world.pop[4]')
  Hint: See 'Vectors'.

# Question 13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use indexing and concatenation to get just the 1st and 4th elements of "world.pop"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'world.pop[c(1,4)]'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('world.pop[c(1,4)]', 'c(world.pop[1], world.pop[4])')
  Hint: See 'Vectors'.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Next, we are going to practice using functions.'

# Question 14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How would you find the length of i.e., the number of elements in, the "world.pop" vector?'
  CorrectAnswer: 'length(world.pop)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(world.pop)')
  Hint: See 'Functions'.

# Question 15
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Create a vector using the sequence function that goes from 1950 to 2010 in increments of 10. Assign this vector to an object called "year".'
  CorrectAnswer: 'year <- seq(from = 1950, to = 2010, by = 10)'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('year <- seq(from = 1950, to = 2010, by = 10)', 'year <- seq(1950, 2010, 10)')
  Hint: See 'Functions'.

# Question 16
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the "year" vector just created to give names to the elements of the "world.pop" vector.'
